# Cut Kubernetes Costs by 60% with Yamify vClusters


---

### 🌍 The Problem:

Running separate Kubernetes clusters for every team or project wastes money:

❌ Multiple control planes = repeated fees

❌ Idle servers = wasted cloud spend

❌ Duplicate tools = extra costs

❌ Complex management = more overhead



---

### ✅ The Yamify Solution: Virtual Clusters (vClusters)

One Kubernetes cluster.
Many isolated virtual clusters for your teams.
No wasted resources.
