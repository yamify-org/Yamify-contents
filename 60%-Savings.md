## 🌟 How Yamify Saves You Money -- Up to 60% Savings

Running Kubernetes (K8s) clusters in the cloud or on your own servers can be expensive — especially when every team or project runs its own cluster. You pay the same fixed costs over and over again for things like control planes, node resources, and monitoring tools. A lot of these costs go to waste when servers sit idle.

### ✅ How Yamify Changes This

With Yamify’s vCluster technology, your teams don’t need separate Kubernetes clusters anymore. Instead, they each get a "virtual cluster" inside one big Kubernetes cluster.

**This means:**

- Fewer clusters to manage

- Less wasted capacity

- Lower cloud fees

- Better use of your servers

### 💸 Real-World Example of Savings

#### 🔴 Traditional Approach:

If 5 teams each run their own Kubernetes cluster on AWS or Google Cloud:

You pay 5 times for control planes (around $360/month or $4,300/year).

You also pay for extra servers (nodes) that mostly sit idle.

Altogether, you might spend $800–$1,000+ per month (or $9,600–$12,000/year).


#### 🟢 With Yamify’s vClusters:

You only pay for one Kubernetes cluster, not 5.

Teams still have their own isolated environments — they just share the same infrastructure.

You use your servers much more efficiently, meaning fewer idle resources.

Your total cost drops to around $300–$400 per month — saving you about $500–$600 per month, or $6,000–$7,000 per year.


That’s a 50–60% cost reduction. As your teams and projects grow, the savings grow too.

🔍 #### Why vClusters Save So Much

🛡️ **Problem with Traditional Clusters**	

- Pay separately for each cluster’s control plane and monitoring tools
- Lots of idle servers wasting money	
- Difficult to manage many clusters	
- Teams leave dev/test clusters running overnight
- Duplicate tools across clusters

🌟 **How Yamify’s vCluster Fixes It**

- Pay for one cluster; virtualize the rest
- Share servers, improving efficiency
- Manage just one cluster with isolated virtual clusters
- Yamify powers them down when idle to save costs
- Share tools like monitoring, saving even more

#### ⚙️ How This Helps You

Lower Cloud Bills: Save on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or your on-prem hardware.

Simpler Management: No need to run 5–20 clusters anymore — one is enough.

Faster for Teams: Developers get isolated spaces fast without extra setup.

Pay Less for Idle Time: Virtual clusters can automatically pause when not in use.

Future-Proof Savings: The more teams or projects you have, the more you save.

📊 #### Typical Cost Savings

#### Scenario	
- 5 small teams on AWS EKS
- 20 small projects on Google GKE
- 5 teams on Azure AKS
- On-prem with 20 servers

#### Without Yamify	
- $800/month
- $34,660/year
- $500/month	
- 20 servers	

#### With Yamify	Savings
- $300/month	~60%
- $7,558/year	~78%
- $300/month	~40%
- 10–12 servers	~50%
