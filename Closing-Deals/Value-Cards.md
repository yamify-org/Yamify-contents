Yamify Sales Made Simple: How to Ask the Right Questions and Close Deals

The Goal:

Help people see how Yamify solves their problems — whether they are developers or startup founders — by asking smart questions and using clear, simple explanations. Don’t sell too hard; guide them to discover the value themselves.


---

1. Talking to Developers

Ask them about their pain points:

How long does it take to deploy models? → Yamify lets you deploy in minutes.

Are you tired of setting up environments and waiting for GPUs? → Yamify does this automatically with one click.

Is latency a problem because your cloud servers are far away? → Yamify has local African data centers for faster speeds.

Are cloud GPU costs hurting your budget? → Yamify is up to 60% cheaper.

Do you want to integrate easily with Kubernetes or your CI/CD tools? → Yamify gives you full control like your own cluster.


👉 Key Point: Let the developer talk about their frustrations, then explain how Yamify solves them.

2. Talking to Startup Founders (Non-Tech People)

Ask them about their business struggles:

What’s stopping you from adding AI to your product? → Yamify makes it simple with pre-built AI models.

How fast do you need your AI product launched? → Yamify gets it done in a day, not months.

Are cloud costs slowing you down? → Yamify is more affordable, no big cloud bills.

Are you worried about data privacy? → Yamify keeps your data in-country (Nigeria, South Africa, etc.).

What AI tool would you use today if it were easy? → Yamify’s marketplace likely already has it ready to deploy.


👉 Key Point: Keep it simple, focus on saving time, reducing cost, and growing their business.

3. Use Value Cards to Explain Benefits

Think of “value cards” like flashcards you can use during your sales talk:

Each card covers one big benefit (speed, cost savings, easy AI tools, integrations).

Example card:
Title: “🚀 Fast Deployment”
Question: “What if you could launch your AI model in minutes instead of months?”
Answer: “Yamify does that with one-click deployment.”


Use the cards based on what the person cares about most (speed, cost, privacy, etc.).

👉 Key Point: Cards help keep your sales conversation focused and clear.

4. How to Get People to Try Yamify (Closing the Deal)

Invite them to try the free plan: “Let’s spin up a demo together right now; you’ll see it live in 5 minutes.”

Show them the free plan has real value, but the paid plans give them more power when they grow.

Offer to help them get started live on a call.

Create excitement: “Imagine having your AI product live by tomorrow.”


👉 Key Point: Make it easy to try. Once they see it works, they’ll want more.


---

5. Use the Right Tone

Be friendly and helpful, not pushy.

For technical people, sound smart but clear.

For business people, sound excited but simple.

Always focus on their problems and how Yamify solves them.



---

✅ In Short:

Ask questions that help people realize they have a problem, then show how Yamify solves it fast, easily, and affordably.
Use clear examples, visual cards, and invite them to try it for free.
