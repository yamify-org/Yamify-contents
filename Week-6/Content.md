## Accelerate: Helping Startups and Developers Launch AI-Powered Products Faster
#

*"Africa has leapfrogged in fintech, healthtech, and mobility. The next leap is AI."*
— **McKinsey, 2023**

### Why Speed Is the New Differentiator

In the global startup ecosystem, time to market is everything. Ideas are cheap—execution is currency. But in Africa, where the median pre-seed round ranges between $25,000 to $100,000, the margin for error is razor thin.

Nowhere is this truer than in AI development, where the average time to build and deploy a working model—from data ingestion to API deployment—can take 8–16 weeks on traditional infrastructure. For African founders without access to in-house ML teams or Silicon Valley-sized budgets, this timeline can be a dealbreaker.

*“Investors don’t just want to see innovation. They want traction. That means shipping fast, iterating faster, and proving market fit in real time.”*
— **Chijioke A., Managing Partner, Accra Ventures**

Yamify was built to make this kind of acceleration possible—for Africa-first startups, bootstrapped builders, and AI-native developers alike.
