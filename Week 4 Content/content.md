## Building Africa's AI Future: Yamify Vision for Education and Infrastructure

*“We cannot wait for the world to train our talent. We must build the future we want by empowering our own.”* — **Luc Okalobe, Founder, Yamify**

Africa stands at a pivotal moment in the global AI revolution. With 70% of its population under 30 and a tech-savvy youth bulge, the continent has the potential to become the next frontier for AI innovation. But unlocking that future depends on two critical pillars: education and infrastructure.

At Yamify, we’re bridging the gap—training builders and providing them with the tools to create.
